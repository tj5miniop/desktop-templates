# THIS IS THE ARCH LINUX BRANCH, IF YOU ARE ON A DEBIAN BASED SYSTEM, SWITCH TO THE DEBIAN BRANCH 

availible desktops for arch -

KDE (sddm display manager)
GNOME (with optional extensions, these can be enabled with the extension managed, which will be installed) (gdm display manager)
i3 (lightdm)
cinnamon (themed with the linux mint colours)

gamescope (steamos gamepadui) (should be installed after any of the above is working WITH the correct drivers)

NViDIA GPU users - nvidia-drm.nomodeset=1 will need to be manually added to the grub config to get wayland (gamescope) working properly.
